                        The MARVELous Writing Prompt is a writing prompt generator for creative writers with an interest in the Marvel comic universe. It's purpose is to give the user inspration for their writing prompt.
                        Using the Marvel API, we are able to present to the user two random characters and one random quote through the Quotes API from RapidAPI for them to use in their writing.
                        This generator can be used by creative writing classes, writing clubs, fanfiction writers, and more.
